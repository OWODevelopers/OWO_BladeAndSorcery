# OWO_BladeAndSorcery
OWO Blade and Sorcery integration  
The sensations are based on the work made by [floh-bhaptics](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/BladeAndSorcery_OWO)

## What is OWO?
OWO Skin is a haptic technology that lets you feel everything that happens in a video game.  
OWO is capable of delivering highly realistic and precise sensations, such as the feeling of impact, the recoil of your weapons or even the subtle sensation of insects moving across your skin.
